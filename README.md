*Steps of NLP*

## Technologies Used
1. **Pyspark** - For Data Engineering
2. **The ML and MLLib libraries** - For prediction
3. **Anvil** - For building the GUI. It is a free Python-based drag-and-drop web app builder.

## Steps to run the GUI
1. Download the files given in the folder ***Anvil Files***. These contain the saved models and vectorizers on which the GUI will run.
2. Run all the cells given in ***Anvil_GUI.ipynb***. This can be found in ***Code Files*** -> ***Anvil_GUI.ipynb***
3. Go to [this link](https://CZNWQDQQC76FC5MI.anvil.app/CTX52FSLFD4YJVPTIRVSXLSV) to run the GUI
